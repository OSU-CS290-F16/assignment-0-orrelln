	<p>When I started this assignment, I had never dealt with github or git before. I had assumed that I would need to do 
	all of the commiting and pushing through putty, so I looked up guides on how to properly work git. However, I realized
	that I didn't have to deal with using git and just do all of the adding, commiting, and pushing through the github
	website. Everything was smooth sailing from there. I learned the basics of git and github from this assignment. I already
	knew the basics of html. The resources that were the most helpful were the git tutorials as most information on Piazza was
	on how to use git. </p>
