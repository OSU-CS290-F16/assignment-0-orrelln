	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>My name is Nicholas Orrell, but I prefer to go by Nick.</li>
		<li>I am a Computer Science major and this is my second year at OSU.</li>
		<li>The most unique experience I've ever had was winning a stock market simulation ran through my highschool. I was with a group of random people from my class, but somehow we invested all of our money into rising stocks and sold them mostly at their peak. I think we cashed out at $1,000,000 while everyone else was sub $600,000. It was all luck and we gambled perfectly.
